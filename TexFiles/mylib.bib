	abstract = {Critical care patients are monitored closely through the course of their illness. As a result of this monitoring, large amounts of data are routinely collected for these patients. Philips Healthcare has developed a telehealth system, the {eICU} Program, which leverages these data to support management of critically ill patients. Here we describe the {eICU} Collaborative Research Database, a multi-center intensive care unit ({ICU})database with high granularity data for over 200,000 admissions to {ICUs} monitored by {eICU} Programs across the United States. The database is deidentified, and includes vital sign measurements, care plan documentation, severity of illness measures, diagnosis information, treatment information, and more. Data are publicly available after registration, including completion of a training course in research with human subjects and signing of a data use agreement mandating responsible handling of the data and adhering to the principle of collaborative research. The freely available nature of the data will support a number of applications including the development of machine learning algorithms, decision support tools, and clinical research.},

	abstract = {As big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence continue to penetrate into and transform many facets of our lives, we are witnessing the emergence of these powerful technologies within health care. The use and growth of these technologies has been contingent on the availability of reliable and usable data, a particularly robust resource in critical care medicine where continuous monitoring forms a key component of the infrastructure of care. The response to this opportunity has included the development of open databases for research and other purposes; the development of a collaborative form of clinical data science intended to fully leverage these data resources, and the creation of data-driven applications for purposes such as clinical decision support. Most recently, data levels have reached the thresholds required for the development of robust artificial intelligence features for clinical purposes. The systematic capture and analysis of clinical data in both individuals and populations allows us to begin to move toward precision medicine in the intensive care unit ({ICU}). In this perspective review, we examine the fundamental role of data as we present the current progress that has been made toward an artificial intelligence ({AI})-supported, data-driven precision critical care medicine.},

	abstract = {Objective
We sought to develop an intensive care unit research database applying automated techniques to aggregate high-resolution diagnostic and therapeutic data from a large, diverse population of adult intensive care unit patients. This freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms.

Design
Data collection and retrospective analysis.

Setting
All adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital.

Patients
Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007.

Interventions
None.

Measurements and Main Results
The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care {II} ({MIMIC}-{II}) database consists of 25,328 intensive care unit stays. The investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. Data were automatically deidentified to comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. The data were made freely available in February 2010 through the Internet along with a detailed user’s guide and an assortment of data processing tools. The overall hospital mortality rate was 11.7\%, which varied by critical care unit. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 2.2 days (interquartile range, 1.1–4.4 days). According to the primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5\% of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39.1\%); trauma (10.2\%); diseases of the digestive system (9.7\%); pulmonary diseases (9.0\%); infectious diseases (7.0\%); and neoplasms (6.8\%).

Conclusions
{MIMIC}-{II} documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records. It establishes a new public-access resource for critical care research, supporting a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule development, and electronic tool development.},

In the historical overview, I emphasize the naive Bayesian classi®er, neural networks and decision trees. I present a comparison of some state-of-the-art systems, representatives from each branch of machine learning, when applied to several medical diagnostic tasks. The future trends are illustrated by two case studies. The ®rst describes a recently developed method for dealing with reliability of decisions of classi®ers, which seems to be promising for intelligent data analysis in medicine. The second describes an approach to using machine learning in order to verify some unexplained phenomena from complementary medicine, which is not (yet) approved by the orthodox medical community but could in the future play an important role in overall medical diagnosis and treatment. \# 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Background: Machine learning techniques may be an effective and efficient way to classify open-text reports on doctor’s activity for the purposes of quality assurance, safety, and continuing professional development. Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained to classify open-text reports of doctor performance and to assess the potential for classifications to identify significant differences in doctors’ professional performance in the United Kingdom. Methods: We used 1636 open-text comments (34,283 words) relating to the performance of 548 doctors collected from a survey of clinicians’ colleagues using the General Medical Council Colleague Questionnaire ({GMC}-{CQ}). We coded 77.75\% (1272/1636) of the comments into 5 global themes (innovation, interpersonal skills, popularity, professionalism, and respect) using a qualitative framework. We trained 8 machine learning algorithms to classify comments and assessed their performance using several training samples. We evaluated doctor performance using the {GMC}-{CQ} and compared scores between doctors with different classifications using t tests. Results: Individual algorithm performance was high (range F score=.68 to .83). Interrater agreement between the algorithms and the human coder was highest for codes relating to “popular” (recall=.97), “innovator” (recall=.98), and “respected” (recall=.87) codes and was lower for the “interpersonal” (recall=.80) and “professional” (recall=.82) codes. A 10-fold cross-validation demonstrated similar performance in each analysis. When combined together into an ensemble of multiple algorithms, mean human-computer interrater agreement was .88. Comments that were classified as “respected,” “professional,” and “interpersonal” related to higher doctor scores on the {GMC}-{CQ} compared with comments that were not classified (P .05). Conclusions: Machine learning algorithms can classify open-text feedback of doctor performance into multiple themes derived by human raters with high performance. Colleague open-text comments that signal respect, professionalism, and being interpersonal may be key indicators of doctor’s performance.  [J Med Internet Res 2017;19(3):e65]},

New analytical techniques, such as sentiment analysis, may allow us to understand and use this information more effectively to improve the quality of health care. Objective: We attempted to use machine learning to understand patients\&\#8217; unstructured comments about their care. We used sentiment analysis techniques to categorize online free-text comments by patients as either positive or negative descriptions of their health care. We tried to automatically predict whether a patient would recommend a hospital, whether the hospital was clean, and whether they were treated with dignity from their free-text description, compared to the patient\&\#8217;s own quantitative rating of their care. Methods: We applied machine learning techniques to all 6412 online comments about hospitals on the English National Health Service website in 2010 using Weka data-mining software. We also compared the results obtained from sentiment analysis with the paper-based national inpatient survey results at the hospital level using Spearman rank correlation for all 161 acute adult hospital trusts in England. Results: There was 81\%, 84\%, and 89\% agreement between quantitative ratings of care and those derived from free-text comments using sentiment analysis for cleanliness, being treated with dignity, and overall recommendation of hospital respectively (kappa scores: .40\&\#8211;.74,  P \&\#60;.001 for all). We observed mild to moderate associations between our machine learning predictions and responses to the large patient survey for the three categories examined (Spearman rho 0.37-0.51,  P \&\#60;.001 for all). Conclusions: The prediction accuracy that we have achieved using this machine learning process suggests that we are able to predict, from free-text, a reasonably accurate assessment of patients\&\#8217; opinion about different performance aspects of a hospital and that these machine learning predictions are associated with results of more conventional surveys.

	abstract = {Background: In contrast to patients with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage ({tSAH}) in the presence of other types of intracranial hemorrhage, the prognosis of patients with isolated {tSAH} is good. The incidence of mortality in these patients ranges from 0–2.5\%. However, few data or predictive models are available for the identification of patients with a high mortality risk. In this study, we aimed to construct a model for mortality prediction using a decision tree ({DT}) algorithm, along with data obtained from a population-based trauma registry, in a Level 1 trauma center. Methods: Five hundred and forty-five patients with isolated {tSAH}, including 533 patients who survived and 12 who died, between January 2009 and December 2016, were allocated to training (n = 377) or test (n = 168) sets. Using the data on demographics and injury characteristics, as well as laboratory data of the patients, classification and regression tree ({CART}) analysis was performed based on the Gini impurity index, using the rpart function in the rpart package in R. Results: In this established {DT} model, three nodes (head Abbreviated Injury Scale ({AIS}) score ≤4, creatinine (Cr) \&lt;1.4 mg/{dL}, and age \&lt;76 years) were identified as important determinative variables in the prediction of mortality. Of the patients with isolated {tSAH}, 60\% of those with a head {AIS} \&gt;4 died, as did the 57\% of those with an {AIS} score ≤4, but Cr ≥1.4 and age ≥76 years. All patients who did not meet the above-mentioned criteria survived. With all the variables in the model, the {DT} achieved an accuracy of 97.9\% (sensitivity of 90.9\% and specificity of 98.1\%) and 97.7\% (sensitivity of 100\% and specificity of 97.7\%), for the training set and test set, respectively. Conclusions: The study established a {DT} model with three nodes (head {AIS} score ≤4, Cr \&lt;1.4, and age \&lt;76 years) to predict fatal outcomes in patients with isolated {tSAH}. The proposed decision-making algorithm may help identify patients with a high risk of mortality.},

	abstract = {Early hospital mortality prediction is critical as intensivists strive to make efficient medical decisions about the severely ill patients staying in intensive care units ({ICUs}). As a result, various methods have been developed to address this problem based on clinical records. However, some of the laboratory test results are time-consuming and need to be processed. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict mortality using features extracted from the heart signals of patients within the first hour of {ICU} admission. In order to predict the risk, quantitative features have been computed based on the heart rate signals of {ICU} patients suffering cardiovascular diseases. Each signal is described in terms of 12 statistical and signal-based features. The extracted features are fed into eight classifiers: decision tree, linear discriminant, logistic regression, support vector machine ({SVM}), random forest, boosted trees, Gaussian {SVM}, and K-nearest neighborhood (K-{NN}). To derive insight into the performance of the proposed method, several experiments have been conducted using the well-known clinical dataset named Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care {III} ({MIMIC}-{III}). The experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}). The decision tree classifier satisfies both accuracy and interpretability better than the other classifiers, producing an F1-score and {AUC} equal to 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. It indicates that heart rate signals can be used for predicting mortality in patients in the care units especially coronary care units ({CCUs}), achieving a comparable performance with existing predictions that rely on high dimensional features from clinical records which need to be processed and may contain missing information.},

	abstract = {Background
Clinical decision support systems are used to help predict patient stability and mortality in the Intensive Care Unit ({ICU}). Accurate patient information can assist clinicians with patient management and in allocating finite resources. However, systems currently in common use have limited predictive value in the clinical setting. The increasing availability of Electronic Health Records ({EHR}) provides an opportunity to use medical information for more accurate patient stability and mortality prediction in the {ICU}.
Objective
Develop and evaluate an algorithm which more accurately predicts patient mortality in the {ICU}, using the correlations between widely available clinical variables from the {EHR}.
Methods
We have developed an algorithm, {AutoTriage}, which uses eight common clinical variables from the {EHR} to assign patient mortality risk scores. Each clinical variable produces a subscore, and combinations of two or three discretized clinical variables also produce subscores. A combination of weighted subscores produces the overall score. We validated the performance of this algorithm in a retrospective study on the {MIMIC} {III} medical {ICU} dataset.
Results
{AutoTriage} 12 h mortality prediction yields an Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic value of 0.88 (95\% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.88). At a sensitivity of 80\%, {AutoTriage} maintains a specificity of 81\% with a diagnostic odds ratio of 16.26.
Conclusions
Through the multidimensional analysis of the correlations between eight common clinical variables, {AutoTriage} provides an improvement in the specificity and sensitivity of patient mortality prediction over existing prediction methods.},

Some studies suggest that elevated glucose levels at admission predict worse outcomes. Elevated Lactate levels have also been reported to be directly associated with increased mortality. We wanted to determine if the combination of admission glucose and lactate levels improves the predictability of inpatient mortality and length of stay ({LOS})., Methods, This is a retrospective study. We included all adult patients admitted at an academic medical center from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. We collected basic clinical information, including age, gender, admission glucose and lactate levels, {LOS}, and mortality. We separated outcomes based on glucose and lactate levels by dividing them into quartiles. We also stratified patients based on normal lactate ({\textless}2.0 mmol/L), high lactate (2.0-4.0 mmol/L), and very high lactate ({\textgreater}4 mmol/L) levels; and on normal glucose (60-140 mg/dl), high glucose (140-200 mg/dl), and very high glucose ({\textgreater}200 mg/dl) levels., Results, A total of 5,436 adult patients were included in our study. The median age was 58 years, and 57\% of the patients were male. The median {LOS} was 6 days, and the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 11\%. When the patients were separated in quartiles based on admission glucose values, mortality was higher in the 4th quartile (≥173 mg/{dL}): 14.87\%, probability value (p): {\textless}0.001. When the patients were separated in quartiles based on lactate levels, the mortality was higher in the 4th quartile (≥2.23 mmol/L): 21.95\%, p: 0.001.

	abstract = {Objective
The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between fasting glucose levels and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Chinese population.
Methods
The role of fasting blood glucose levels as a predictor of all-cause and cause-specific mortality was estimated in 9930 participants from four Chinese general populations with a 20-year follow-up. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify the relationship between fasting glucose and mortality.
Results
There were 1471 deaths after a median follow-up of 20.2 years (a total of 187,374 person-years), including 310 cardiovascular deaths, 581 cancer deaths, and 580 other-cause deaths. After adjustment for age, sex, urban or rural, northern or southern of China, types of work, education level, physical exercise, smoking status, drinking status, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and serum total cholesterol at baseline, the hazard ratios ({HRs}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) for all-cause mortality in the fasting blood glucose categories of {\textless}60, 60–69, 70–79, 90–99, 100–109, 110–125, and ≥126 mg/dl were 1.38 (1.04–1.84), 1.20 (1.01–1.43), 1.18 (1.03–1.36), 1.18 (0.99–1.41), 1.48 (1.16–1.88), 1.17 (0.84–1.62), and 2.23 (1.72–2.90), respectively, in contrast to the reference group (80–89 mg/dl). The {HRs} and 95\% {CIs} for cardiovascular disease mortality in these groups were 2.58 (1.44–4.61), 1.41 (0.95–2.10), 1.56 (1.15–2.11), 1.29 (0.88–1.89), 1.36 (0.78–2.37), 1.05 (0.52–2.11), and 2.73 (1.64–4.56), respectively.

Both low and high fasting glucose were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in Chinese general population.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine whether values of arterial base excess or lactate taken on admission to a general intensive care unit indicate prognosis, and whether this can be used as a screening tool for future intensive care admissions.
{DESIGN}: Observational study.
{SETTING}: University teaching hospital general adult intensive care unit.
{PATIENTS}: 148 consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit.
{INTERVENTIONS}: Arterial blood samples were obtained on admission to the intensive care unit and 24 h following admission.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Arterial base excess and lactate concentrations were measured from the blood samples. Both base excess and arterial lactate samples on admission have good prognostic abilities (area under the curve on receiver operator characteristic analysis of 0.73, 0.78, respectively). The value of base excess on admission with the best predictive ability was a base excess more negative than -4 mmol/l, and the corresponding value for lactate was greater than 1.5 mmol/l. The combination of these two markers on admission to the intensive care unit led to a sensitivity of 80.3 \% and a specificity of 58.7 \% for mortality. The achievement of this combination was associated with an increased mortality (50.6 \% vs. 15 \%, p {\textless} 0.0001), older age (70 vs. 61.5 years, p {\textless} 0.05), a greater requirement for inotropic support (30.9 \% vs. 4.5\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) and higher organ failure scores both on admission and for the subsequent 24 h.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Both base excess and lactate, or the combination of the two, can be used to predict outcome in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. These variables could be utilized to identify patients who have a high risk for mortality and thus who should be admitted to the intensive care unit.},

	abstract = {Increased blood lactate levels (hyperlactataemia) are common in critically ill patients. Although frequently used to diagnose inadequate tissue oxygenation, other processes not related to tissue oxygenation may increase lactate levels. Especially in critically ill patients, increased glycolysis may be an important cause of hyperlactataemia. Nevertheless, the presence of increased lactate levels has important implications for the morbidity and mortality of the hyperlactataemic patients. Although the term lactic acidosis is frequently used, a significant relationship between lactate and {pH} only exists at higher lactate levels. The term lactate associated acidosis is therefore more appropriate. Two recent studies have underscored the importance of monitoring lactate levels and adjust treatment to the change in lactate levels in early resuscitation. As lactate levels can be measured rapidly at the bedside from various sources, structured lactate measurements should be incorporated in resuscitation protocols.},

{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS} This was a retrospective cohort study of 4,098 cardiac surgery patients treated between 2011 and 2015. Patients were stratified by {DM} and glucose-lowering medication history. Hyperglycemia (glucose {\textgreater}180 mg/{dL}), hypoglycemia ({\textless}70 mg/{dL}), and the hyperglycemic index were assessed postoperatively (48 h). The relationship between lactate and glucose levels was modeled using generalized linear regression. Mortality was analyzed using an extended Cox regression model.
{RESULTS} Hyperglycemia occurred in 26.0\% of patients without {DM} ({NODM}), 46.5\% with {DM} without prior drug treatment ({DMNT}), 62.8\% on oral medication ({DMOM}), and 73.8\% on insulin therapy ({DMIT}) (P {\textless} 0.0001). Hypoglycemia occurred in 6.3\%, 9.1\%, 8.8\%, and 10.8\% of {NODM}, {DMNT}, {DMOM}, and {DMIT}, respectively (P = 0.0012). The lactate levels of all patients were temporarily increased with surgery. This increase was greater in patients who also had hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and was markedly attenuated in patients with {DM}. Peak lactate was 5.8 mmol/L (95\% {CI} 5.6, 6.0) in {NODM} with hyperglycemia vs. 3.3 (95\% {CI} 3.2, 3.4) without hyperglycemia; in {DMNT}: 4.8 (95\% {CI} 4.4, 5.2) vs. 3.4 (95\% {CI} 3.1, 3.6); in {DMOM}: 3.8 (95\% {CI} 3.5, 4.1) vs. 2.9 (95\% {CI} 2.7, 3.1); and in {DMIT}: 3.3 (95\% {CI} 3.0, 3.5) vs. 2.7 (95\% {CI} 2.3, 3.0). Increasing lactate levels were associated with increasing mortality; increasing glucose reduced this effect in {DM} but not in {NODM} (P = 0.0069 for three-way interaction).
{CONCLUSIONS} Stress hyperlactatemia is markedly attenuated in patients with {DM}. There is a three-way interaction among {DM}, stress hyperlactatemia, and stress hyperglycemia associated with mortality after cardiac surgery.},

	abstract = {Metabolic pathways involved in lactate metabolism are important to understand the physiological response to exercise and the pathogenesis of prevalent diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Monocarboxylate transporters are being investigated as potential targets for diagnosis and therapy of these and other disorders. Glucose and alanine produce pyruvate which is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase in the cytoplasm without oxygen consumption. Lactate removal takes place via its oxidation to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate may be either oxidized to carbon dioxide producing energy or transformed into glucose. Pyruvate oxidation requires oxygen supply and the cooperation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Enzymes of the gluconeogenesis pathway sequentially convert pyruvate into glucose. Congenital or acquired deficiency on gluconeogenesis or pyruvate oxidation, including tissue hypoxia, may induce lactate accumulation. Both obese individuals and patients with diabetes show elevated plasma lactate concentration compared to healthy subjects, but there is no conclusive evidence of hyperlactatemia causing insulin resistance. Available evidence suggests an association between defective mitochondrial oxidative capacity in the pancreatic β-cells and diminished insulin secretion that may trigger the development of diabetes in patients already affected with insulin resistance. Several mutations in the mitochondrial {DNA} are associated with diabetes mellitus, although the pathogenesis remains unsettled. Mitochondrial {DNA} mutations have been detected in a number of human cancers. d-lactate is a lactate enantiomer normally formed during glycolysis. Excess d-lactate is generated in diabetes, particularly during diabetic ketoacidosis. d-lactic acidosis is typically associated with small bowel resection.},

	abstract = {Early aggressive hemodynamic resuscitation using elevated plasma lactate as a marker is an essential component of managing critically ill patients. Therefore, measurement of blood lactate is recommended to stratify patients based on the need for fluid resuscitation and the risks of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death. Hyperlactatemia is common among critically ill patients, and lactate levels and their trend may be reliable markers of illness severity and mortality. Although hyperlactatemia has been widely recognized as a marker of tissue hypoxia/hypoperfusion, it can also result from increased or accelerated aerobic glycolysis during the stress response. Additionally, lactate may represent an important energy source for patients in critical condition. Despite its inherent complexity, the current simplified view of hyperlactatemia is that it reflects the presence of global tissue hypoxia/hypoperfusion with anaerobic glycolysis. This review of hyperlactatemia in critically ill patients focuses on its pathophysiological aspects and recent clinical approaches. Hyperlactatemia in critically ill patients must be considered to be related to tissue hypoxia/hypoperfusion. Therefore, appropriate hemodynamic resuscitation is required to correct the pathological condition immediately. However, hyperlactatemia can also result from aerobic glycolysis, unrelated to tissue dysoxia, which is unlikely to respond to increases in systemic oxygen delivery. Because hyperlactatemia may be simultaneously related to, and unrelated to, tissue hypoxia, physicians should recognize that resuscitation to normalize plasma lactate levels could be over-resuscitation and may worsen the physiological status. Lactate is a reliable indicator of sepsis severity and a marker of resuscitation; however, it is an unreliable marker of tissue hypoxia/hypoperfusion.},

	abstract = {Background: The development of renal and liver dysfunction may be accompanied by initially subtle derangements in the gluconeogenetic function. Discrepantly low glucose levels combined with high lactate levels might indicate an impaired Cori cycle. Our objective was to examine the relation between early lactate and glucose levels with subsequent renal and liver dysfunction and hospital mortality in critically ill patients.
Methods: Over a 4-year period (2011 to 2014), all adult patients admitted to our adult 48-bed teaching hospital intensive care unit ({ICU}) for at least 12 h were retrospectively analyzed. Lactate and glucose were regularly measured with point-of-care analyzers in all {ICU} patients. Lactate and glucose measurements were collected from 6 h before to 24 h after {ICU} admission. Patients with fewer than four lactate/glucose measurements were excluded. Patients received insulin according to a computer-guided control algorithm that aimed at a glucose level {\textless}8.0 mmol/L. Renal dysfunction was defined as the development of acute kidney injury ({AKI}) within 7 days, and liver function was based on the maximal bilirubin in the 7-day period following {ICU} admission. Mean lactate and mean glucose were classified into quintiles and univariate and multivariate analyses were related with renal and liver dysfunction and hospital mortality. Since glucose has a known U-shaped relation with outcome, we also accounted for this.
Results: We analyzed 92,000 blood samples from 9074 patients (63\% males) with a median age of 64 years and a hospital mortality of 11\%. Both lactate quintiles (≤1.0; 1.0–1.3; 1.3–1.7; 1.7–2.3; {\textgreater}2.3 mmol/L) and glucose quintiles (≤7.0; 7.0–7.6; 7.6–8.2; 8.2–9.0; {\textgreater}9.0 mmol/L) were related with outcome in univariate analysis (p {\textless} 0.001). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ({APACHE}) {IV}, lactate, and glucose were associated with renal and liver dysfunction in multivariate analysis (p {\textless} 0.001), with a U-shaped relationship for glucose. The combination of the highest lactate quintile with the lowest glucose quintile was associated with the highest rates of renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, and mortality (p {\textless} 0.001) with a significant interaction between lactate and glucose (p ≤ 0.001).
Conclusions: Abnormal combined lactate and glucose measurements may provide an early indication of organ dysfunction. In critically ill patients a ‘normal’ glucose with an elevated lactate should not be considered desirable, as this combination is related with increased mortality.},

	abstract = {Background. Lactate has been widely used as a risk indicator of outcomes in critically ill patients due to its ready measurement and good predictive ability. However, the interconnections between lactate metabolism and glucose metabolism have not been sufficiently explored, yet. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether glucose levels could influence the predictive ability of lactate and design a more comprehensive strategy to assess the in-hospital mortality of critically ill patients. Methods. We analyzed the clinical data of 293 critically ill patients. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The logistic regression analysis and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUROC}) were applied to evaluate the predictive ability of lactate in association with glucose. Results. The lactate level showed significant association with in-hospital mortality, and its predictive ability was also comparable to other prognostic scores such as the {SOFA} score and {APACHE} {II} score. We further divided 293 patients into three groups based on glucose levels: low-glucose group ({\textless}7 mmol/L), medium-glucose group (7-9 mmol/L), and high-glucose group ({\textgreater}9 mmol/L). The lactate level was associated with in-hospital mortality in the low- and high- glucose groups, but not in the medium-glucose group, whereas the {SOFA} score and {APACHE} {II} score were associated with in-hospital mortality in all three glucose groups. The {AUROC} of lactate in the medium-glucose group was also the lowest among the three glucose groups, indicating a decrease in its predictive ability. Conclusions. Our findings demonstrated that the predictive ability of lactate to assess in-hospital mortality could be influenced by glucose levels. In the medium glucose level (i.e., 7-9 mmol/L), lactate was inadequate to predict in-hospital mortality and the {SOFA} score; the {APACHE} {II} score should be utilized as a complementation in order to obtain a more accurate prediction.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} 
        The efficacy of vitamin C ({VitC}) and thiamine ({THMN}) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit ({ICU}) with sepsis is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of {VitC} and {THMN} on mortality and lactate clearance in {ICU} patients. We hypothesized that survival and lactate clearance would be improved when treated with thiamine and/or {VitC}.
        {METHODS} 
        The Philips {eICU} database version 2.0 was queried for patients admitted to the {ICU} in 2014 to 2015 for 48 hours or longer and patients with sepsis and an elevated lactate of 2.0 mmol/L or greater. Subjects were categorized according to the receipt of {VitC}, {THMN}, both, or neither. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcome was lactate clearance defined as lactate less than 2.0 mmol/L achieved after maximum lactate. Univariable comparisons included age, sex, race, Acute Physiology Score {III}, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ({APACHE}) {IVa} score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, surgical {ICU} admission status, intubation status, hospital region, liver disease, vasopressors, steroids, {VitC} and {THMN} orders. Kaplan-Meier curves, logistic regression, propensity score matching, and competing risks modeling were constructed.
        {RESULTS} 
        Of 146,687 patients from 186 hospitals, 7.7\% (n = 11,330) were included. Overall mortality was 25.9\% (n = 2,930). Evidence in favor of an association between {VitC} and/or {THMN} administration, and survival was found on log rank test (all p {\textless} 0.001). After controlling for confounding factors, {VitC} (adjusted odds ratio [{AOR}], 0.69 [0.50–0.95]) and {THMN} ({AOR}, 0.71 [0.55–0.93]) were independently associated with survival and {THMN} was associated with lactate clearance ({AOR}, 1.50 [1.22–1.96]). On competing risk model {VitC} ({AOR}, 0.675 [0.463–0.983]), {THMN} ({AOR}, 0.744 [0.569–0.974]), and {VitC}+{THMN} ({AOR}, 0.335 [0.13–0.865]) were associated with survival but not lactate clearance. For subgroup analysis of patients on vasopressors, {VitC}+{THMN} were associated with lactate clearance ({AOR}, 1.85 [1.05–3.24]) and survival ({AOR}, 0.223 [0.0678–0.735]).
        {CONCLUSION} 
        {VitC}+{THMN} is associated with increased survival in septic {ICU} patients. Randomized, multicenter trials are needed to better understand their effects on outcomes.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: 
        Acute gastrointestinal ({GI}) bleed is a common reason for hospitalization with 2\%–10\% risk of mortality. In this study, we developed a machine learning ({ML}) model to calculate the risk of mortality in intensive care unit patients admitted for {GI} bleed and compared it with {APACHE} {IVa} risk score. We used explainable {ML} methods to provide insight into the model's prediction and outcome.
        {METHODS}: 
        We analyzed the patient data in the Electronic Intensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database and extracted data for 5,691 patients (mean age = 67.4 years; 61\% men) admitted with {GI} bleed. The data were used in training a {ML} model to identify patients who died in the intensive care unit. We compared the predictive performance of the {ML} model with the {APACHE} {IVa} risk score. Performance was measured by area under receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) analysis. This study also used explainable {ML} methods to provide insights into the model's outcome or prediction using the {SHAP} ({SHapley} Additive {exPlanations}) method.
        {RESULTS}: 
        The {ML} model performed better than the {APACHE} {IVa} risk score in correctly classifying the low-risk patients. The {ML} model had a specificity of 27\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 25–36) at a sensitivity of 100\% compared with the {APACHE} {IVa} score, which had a specificity of 4\% (95\% {CI}: 3–31) at a sensitivity of 100\%. The model identified patients who died with an {AUC} of 0.85 (95\% {CI}: 0.80–0.90) in the internal validation set, whereas the {APACHE} {IVa} clinical scoring systems identified patients who died with {AUC} values of 0.80 (95\% {CI}: 0.73–0.86) with P value {\textless}0.001.
        {DISCUSSION}: 
        We developed a {ML} model that predicts the mortality in patients with {GI} bleed with a greater accuracy than the current scoring system. By making the {ML} model explainable, clinicians would be able to better understand the reasoning behind the outcome.},

We hypothesized that a sequential modeling approach wherein an initial regression model assigns risk and all patients deemed high risk then have their risk quantified by a second, high-risk-specific, regression model would result in a model with superior calibration across the risk spectrum. We compared this approach to a logistic regression model and a sophisticated machine learning approach, the gradient boosting machine. The sequential approach did not have an effect on the receiver operating characteristic curve or the precision-recall curve but resulted in improved reliability curves. The gradient boosting machine achieved a small improvement in discrimination performance and was similarly calibrated to the sequential models.},

	abstract = {In the cyber era, Machine Learning ({ML}) has provided us with the solutions to unstructured data problems with the implementation of Gradient Boosting Machines ({GBM}). We have ample algorithms to choose from to do gradient boosting for our training data but still, we encounter different issues like poor accuracy, high loss, large variance in the result. Here, we are going to introduce you to a state of the art machine learning algorithm {XGBoost} built by Tianqi Chen, that will not only overcome the issues but also perform exceptionally well for regression and classification problems. This blog will help you discover the insights, techniques, and skills with {XGBoost} that you can then bring to your machine learning projects.
{eXtreme} Gradient Boosting ({XGBoost}) is a scalable and improved version of the gradient boosting algorithm (terminology alert) designed for efficacy, computational speed and model performance. It is an open-source library and a part of the Distributed Machine Learning Community. {XGBoost} is a perfect blend of software and hardware capabilities designed to enhance existing boosting techniques with accuracy in the shortest amount of time. Here’s a quick look at an objective benchmark comparison of {XGBoost} with other gradient boosting algorithms trained on random forest with 500 trees, performed by Szilard Pafka.},

	abstract = {The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen’s kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from −1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen’s suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},
