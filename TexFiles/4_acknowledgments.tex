\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This master's thesis has been done at the Department of Electronic Systems at \acrfull{NTNU} during the Spring semester 2020, and is written at the \acrfull{UPC} during September and a few weeks in October. It is my conclusion of the Master of Science in Telecommunications Engineering.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Pierluigi Salvo Rossi, for guiding me throughout my stay in Norway and the freedom he gave me to focus on my work under no pressure. I also want to express my gratitude to my co-advisor, Eline Stenwig, for her help, kindness, and patience. Moreover, I am thankful to my supervisor at \acrshort{UPC}, Veronica Vilaplana Besler, for her prompt responses and helpful guidance.

Finally, I am grateful to my friends whom I am lucky to have them in my life.
